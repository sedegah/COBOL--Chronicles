# COBOL Session 4 – Loops and File Handling

##  Overview

This session introduces two core COBOL concepts:

1. **Loops** using `PERFORM` (iteration control in COBOL).
2. **Basic file handling**, including reading and writing data.


##  What I Covered

### 1. Loops in COBOL

* **`PERFORM UNTIL`**: Executes statements until a condition becomes true.
* **`PERFORM TIMES`**: Repeats a block of code for a fixed number of iterations.


### 2. File Handling Basics

COBOL uses 4 main file verbs:

* **`OPEN`** – Open the file for input or output.
* **`READ`** – Read data from a file.
* **`WRITE`** – Write data to a file.
* **`CLOSE`** – Close the file after use.

## Exercise

Write a COBOL program that:

1. Accepts 3 product names from the user.
2. Stores them in a file.
3. Reads the file and displays the product list.

Would you like me to **add the solution for the product exercise (with file writing + reading)** inside this README so it’s a complete reference? (like an example project).
