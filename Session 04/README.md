# COBOL Session 4 – Loops and File Handling

**Two Tracks Today**
- Looping with `PERFORM`
- Basic file I/O verbs

**Files**
- iteration.cob
- file-handling.cob

**Loop Highlights**
- `PERFORM UNTIL` for condition-based repetition
- `PERFORM TIMES` for fixed counts

**File Verbs (Quick List)**
OPEN → READ → WRITE → CLOSE

**Exercise Prompt**
Create a small program that accepts 3 product names, saves them to a file, then reads and displays the list.
