# COBOL Chronicles

Welcome to COBOL Chronicles — a personal learning repository where I document my exploration of COBOL, the language that still powers many of the world’s financial and governmental systems.

This repository includes:
- Foundational COBOL syntax and simple programs
- Mini projects such as payroll systems, banking apps, and file record processors
- Notes on COBOL structure: divisions, PIC formatting, control flow, and more
- File I/O examples and integration with modern programming tools
- Personal reflections and learnings at each milestone

## Why COBOL?
COBOL (Common Business-Oriented Language) may date back to the 1950s, but it remains essential for legacy systems in banks, insurance companies, and governments. Learning COBOL opens the door to niche, high-value opportunities where maintenance and modernization are in demand.

## Roadmap
- [x] Hello World
- [x] Basic arithmetic operations
- [ ] Understanding Data and Procedure Divisions
- [ ] File writing and reading
- [ ] Build a full payroll management system
- [ ] Develop a bank account manager
- [ ] Integrate COBOL output with a Python/Flask API
- [ ] Explore z/OS and JCL basics

This repository serves both as a hands-on playground and a documentation of my journey toward becoming proficient in COBOL.
